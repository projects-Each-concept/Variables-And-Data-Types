Calculate the exact age in years, months, and days based on the user's date of birth.
Handle edge cases like leap years.


Suppose my date of birth is 23/10/1978

Today is 5/5/2020 . This means my last birthday was 23/10/2019

23/10/2019

23/10/1978 subtracting

00/00/41 years completed.

Now today is 5/5/2020

No. Of months completed from23,10,2019 =NOV, DEC,JAN, FEB,MARCH, APRIL=6 months complete on 23/4/2020

Now no. Of days 24April to 5 May 2020=Apr2020â€“7+ may 5=12days

So today my age is 41 yrs 6 months,12 days
