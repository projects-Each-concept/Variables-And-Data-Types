Calculate the exact age in years, months, and days based on the user's date of birth.
Handle edge cases like leap years.


Suppose my date of birth is 23/10/1978

Today is 5/5/2020 . This means my last birthday was 23/10/2019

23/10/2019

23/10/1978 subtracting

00/00/41 years completed.

Now today is 5/5/2020

No. Of months completed from23,10,2019 =NOV, DEC,JAN, FEB,MARCH, APRIL=6 months complete on 23/4/2020

Now no. Of days 24April to 5 May 2020=Apr2020–7+ may 5=12days

So today my age is 41 yrs 6 months,12 days


-- To calculate age manually, you can follow these steps:

Determine the Birth Date and Current Date: Write down the person's birth date and the current date. For example, if someone was born on March 15, 1990, and today is August 15, 2024.
Break Down the Dates: Separate the dates into components: year, month, and day.
- Birth Date: March 15, 1990
- Current Date: August 15, 2024
Calculate the Year Difference: Subtract the birth year from the current year.
- 2024 - 1990 = 34 years
Adjust for the Month and Day:
- Since the current month (August) is after the birth month (March), no adjustment is needed. If the current month were before the birth month, you would subtract one year from the total.
- If the current month is the same as the birth month, check the day. If today’s day is before the birth day, subtract one year.
Final Age Calculation: Combine the results from the year calculation and any adjustments made based on the month and day.
Example:

Birth Date: March 15, 1990
Current Date: August 15, 2024
Year difference: 2024 - 1990 = 34 years
Month (August) is after March, so no adjustment is needed.
Final Age: 34 years old.
